    Load image data from directory `data_dir`.

    Assume `data_dir` has one directory named after each category, numbered
    0 through NUM_CATEGORIES - 1. Inside each category directory will be some
    number of image files.
    
    Use the OpenCV-Python module (cv2) to read each image as a numpy.ndarray (a numpy multidimensional array). To pass these images into a neural network, the images will need to be the same size, so be sure to resize each image to have width IMG_WIDTH and height IMG_HEIGHT.

    Your function should be platform-independent: that is to say, it should work regardless of operating system. Note that on macOS, the / character is used to separate path components, while the \ character is used on Windows. Use os.sep and os.path.join as needed instead of using your platformâ€™s specific separator character.
    
    Return tuple `(images, labels)`. `images` should be a list of all
    of the images in the data directory, where each image is formatted as a
    numpy ndarray with dimensions IMG_WIDTH x IMG_HEIGHT x 3. `labels` should
    be a list of integer labels, representing the categories for each of the
    corresponding `images`.
